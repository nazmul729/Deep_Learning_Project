# Sales Rate Prediction Using Recurrent Neural Network

Sales rate prediction is very important and have a deep impact in every company’s economic developments. A rise or fall in the amount of sales has an 
immense role in determining the amount of production. This determination is not limited only for Shampoo product but it can be possible to every kind of 
industrial productions. However, this work is restricted for Sales of Shampoo products. This dataset (Sales of Shampoo) is a single featured dataset 
(There have just a single value i.e., the amount of sales of Shampoo per month). The proposed method has 2 architectures with 2 most used Recurrent Neural 
Networks named LSTM and GRU for time series data, and finally made comparison between them. Here, sales amount prediction has been done for next 5 months. 
The architecture with GRU is simple, practical, effective and promising in the field of sales rate prediction. By comparing the results of the prediction 
figures and mean squared errors, it is concluded that GRU architecture performs better than LSTM’s one.
